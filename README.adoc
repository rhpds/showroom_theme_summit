= An Antora theme for Red Hat Summit

While the theme is ready to be used with Antora, the intent is that you'll fork it and customize it for your own needs.
It's intentionally minimalistic so as to give you a good starting point without requiring too much effort to customize.

== Use the Red Hat Summit Theme UI

If you want to simply use the theme for your Antora-generated site, add the following UI configuration to your playbook:

[source,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://github.com/rhpds/showroom_theme_summit/releases/download/v0.0.1/ui-bundle.zip
----
